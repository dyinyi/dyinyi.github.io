		</p>

		<p>
			Born and raised in a small town in Zhejiang Province, China, he spent most of his childhood going to school and going to more classes after school. After getting a dial-up in his family, he has become an avid consumer of the internet ever since. Upon high school graduation, he went to UK to pursue higher education, during which he developed his love for rock music, stand-up comedy and competitive gaming. So after getting his bachelor degree, he went to USA, Boston and became a CS student. Being at the receiving end of the internet for years, he decided to put how to properly contribute to the internet on the list of the skills he must acquire so he can repay the almighty internet god(s). Enrolling comp20 was one of the steps to do so.
